<h2>First Step</h2>

First step is to go to our support center URL and create a ticket through the perspetive of a customer.

I created a couple tickets for this demonstration.

We are then going to log in to our osTicket system but log in pretending to be an agent to see what it'slike to deal with a ticket that comes through.

Fitstly we are going to observe and set some of the settings regarding which ticket is most important by setting the priority and impact.

For this ticket we created a high business impact ticket where servers were down causing internet issues which prohibited Crystal from checking out customers and unable to sell items due to registers being down. So we edit the business impact to an emergency due to its high risk.

For the SLA plan we changed it to SEV-A because it's iminent that that high level ticket gets resolved quickly

We then reassigned the ticket to a higher position which would be the System Administrators because maybe the help desk team is not equipped to handle or may not be allowed to handle something like that. So, we transferred the ticket to them.

After setting those settings you can see when you change things on a ticket there's usually a documentation or history where it shows all updates that are being made for a ticket.

In this image we let the team know that we are coordinating with the sys admin team to get this fixed.

Emergency ticket shown above.

Here we "fixed" the issue so we head to the ticket and explained what happened after that we can either press resolved or close the ticket on ticket status.

After we hit post reply the ticket is now closed and it shows the documentation of what occured and how the workers resolved the issue.





<h2>Ticket SEV-B</h2>

</p>
<p>
On this last ticket we are resolving an issue with replacing a laptop for Jo's team. Fixing the issue by sending them a backup laptop while trying to fix the sticky keyboard and updating their mac to a newer software. After completion John sends it back through express packaging so they can have it ASAP and ship the backup laptop back to HQ. The ticket is now complete and we can now close the ticket.
